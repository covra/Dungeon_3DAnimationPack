	==============
	
	 - Drag&Drop the object to the scene. This animation simultate two spiky walls smashing whatever is in the middle of both.
	  It  has a hit trigger built-in which makes the player a ragdoll for a seconds
	  
	 - With this animation i wanted to change the way of how i do the animations: Instead curves, i used
	 MoveTo and  RotateTo. I think is not better or worst, just different.
	 
	 
	 - Under 'Client Context' folder you will find all FX's of the animation, the spiky walls	and a editable value:
	 'timeRepeatCycle' to set the time between 2 animations. Also setting this value different when you have more than 1 
	 object, it will de-synchro the animations, making them more 'realistics'
